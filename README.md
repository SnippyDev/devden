# DevDen Project Hub

Welcome to the DevDen project space! This is a collaborative and async-friendly place to build tools, interfaces, and Python-powered projects. Whether you're a full-time coder or just dropping in between school or life, you're welcome here.

## Project Goals

This repo hosts community-driven projects focused on:

- Front-end development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript)
- Python tools, scripts, and integrations
- Clean, documented, and accessible code

## Collaboration Guidelines

### 1. Work Asynchronously

We understand people (including me) may not always be online. Work at your own pace.

### 2. Share Live Updates (if active)

If you're currently editing something and someone else might be too, please:

- Post in the `#working-on` channel in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/ksS7rVVxfa)
- Let others know what file or feature you're working on

### 3. Use Branches

- Create a new branch for every feature or fix (e.g. `feature/login-form`, `fix/navbar-css`)
- Always open a Pull Request (PR), even for your own code
- Use `WIP` in the PR title if it's still being developed

### 4. Keep It Clear

- Comment your code
- Write meaningful commit messages
- If you go inactive mid-feature, leave a note in `progress.md` or open a draft PR so others can pick it up

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repo  
2. Clone your fork:  
   `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/devden.git`  
3. Create a new branch:
